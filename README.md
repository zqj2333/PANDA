# PANDA

Power efficiency is a critical design objective in modern microprocessor design. To evaluate the impact of architectural-level design decisions, an accurate yet efficient architecture-level power model is desired. However, widely adopted data-independent analytical power models like McPAT and Wattch have been criticized for their unreliable accuracy. While some machine learning (ML) methods have been proposed for architecture-level power modeling, they rely on sufficient known designs for training and perform poorly when the number of available designs is limited, which is typically the case in realistic scenarios. PANDA is an architecture-level power evaluation method by unifying analytical and machine learning solutions. We propose PANDA, an innovative architecture-level solution that combines the advantages of analytical and ML power models. It achieves unprecedented high accuracy on unknown new designs even when there are very limited designs for training, which is a common challenge in practice. 


## Introduction
The modeling flow of McPAT-Calib can be divided into two parts, the focus is on PANDA Power Evaluation:
1) Microarchitecture Simulation: Use the microarchitecture simulator (gem5) to complete the simulation of the given BOOM microarchitecture configuration and benchmark.
2) PANDA Power Evaluation: Using the configuration parameters and events generated by the microarchitecture simulator to predict the power consumption.

## Quick Start
We prepared a example dataset in "example_data", with feature_set and label_set. So you can just run the PANDA power model, the result will be visulized as figures in "result_figure". (The example dataset is coming soon!)
```
cd power_model
python PANDA.py
```
